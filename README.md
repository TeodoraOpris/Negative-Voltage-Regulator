# Negative-Voltage-Regulator

During the third academic year at University Politehnica Bucharest, I had to design, simulate, debug, and physically implement a negative voltage regulator (NVR).
The schematic and PCB design were done using Orcad Capture CIS and PSpice. 

The NVR had a supply voltage between -30 and -26 V, with a negative programmable output voltage between -22 and -20 V. Additionally, the measured output current through the load had to be between 0 and 26 mA. 

Other requirements regarding the board dimensions, layers, and overall design were considered to ensure the best performance of the device. All these parameters and project requirements are mentioned on page 3 of the project document _PR1_Teodora_Opris_431G.pdf_.
